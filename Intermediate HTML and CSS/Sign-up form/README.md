# Project: Sign-up form
## Introduction
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

## Solving process
First of all is to set the basic layout. The design image clearly shows two main areas: one with the image and the title, and one with the form and other text.

The first step is to ensure both sections show with the right proportions and behave reponsively in a way that is intuitive. Given that it's said that there's no need to make it look good for mobile, we're gonna overlook that step. We create an \<aside\> and a \<main\> tags to both create containers to applying `flex` and to also give *semantic* meaning to the containers.

After that, we can start working on the differents sections. I decided to start with the title one given that it seemed simpler. The section can be simply reproduced by applying the image as a background and then creating a container for the title, including the image.

## Concepts applied from this section
- CSS Default Styles: Used 'The Meyer Reset' to reset the default styles
- CSS Units: used *rem* units for the title so that the texts adjusts its size responsively
